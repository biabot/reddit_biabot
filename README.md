This is just a reddit bot for biathlon results, code is a bit dirty so dont mind me !

There is a config file needed for this bot, you need a praw.ini file with your login credential, format is like that : 

```shell
[biabot]
client_id=XXXXX
client_secret=XXXXX
password=XXXXX
username=XXXX
user_agent=XXXX
```
